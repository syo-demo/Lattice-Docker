# Push Your First Application

To push an application to Lattice, it must be packaged as a Docker application.

## Start Docker and Lattice

 . Ensure ltc is available - run `ltc -version`.
 . Check VirtualBox to make sure the Lattice VM is running.
 .. To run Lattice, go to wherever you cloned lattice from github and run `vagrant up`.

All the setup instructions are in link:install.adoc[Installation Guide].

## Create a Docker Application

We will use the application from the _Spring Boot with Docker_ Getting Started guide:
https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/

This is a simple application using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

Pull the code from github and go straight to the solution directory:

```
  > git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot-docker.git
  > cd gs-spring-boot-docker/complete
```

__Note:__ If you would like to know how this application works, feel free to go through the guide and follow the steps.

Make sure you have the DOCKER enviroment variables set:

```
  > env | grep DOCKER
```

If they aren't set refer to the link:install.adoc#docker-setup[Installation Guide].

Remember the DOCKER_HOST URL, you will need the IP address soon (it will be something like
`DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376`)

## Build the Application

### Build Using Maven

We need to edit the `pom.xml` to change the `docker.image.prefix` property from `springio` (since you re not a member of
the `springio` organization at Dockerhub), to your Docker Hub username (<yourid>).

Now run

```
$ mvn package docker:build
```

Note that the Maven build currently fails on Windows.



## Exploring `ltc` Commands

Enter `ltc help` for a list of commands you can use to manage your apps.
For example, get a list of all apps using `ltc list`, or see the status of an app using the `ltc status <app-name>` command.

Open another terminal window and tail the logs using the `ltc logs` command.



## Scaling Your App

A more interesting application is this one, which we will scale to 3 instances (just like we can on Cloud Foundry)

```
ltc create spring-cloud-lattice-sample springcloud/spring-cloud-lattice-sample
ltc scale spring-cloud-lattice-sample 3
```

Go to http://spring-cloud-lattice-sample.<lattice-url>?service=spring-cloud-lattice-sample and verify you
can see the JSON service record. Refresh the browser multiple times notice how the uri attribute rotates.

And here http://spring-cloud-lattice-sample.<lattice-url>/me to see a pared down record that also rotates the uri.

## Using X-Ray

Now that you've got a couple apps running in Lattice, let's use X-Ray to visualize the apps.  Navigate to http://xray.cfapps.io.
For the Receptor URL, enter http://user:pass@receptor.<lattice-url>.

X-Ray will display a single row showing colour-coded blocks indicating each instance of each deployed app.  Since
your installation consists of only a single cell, only 1 row is displayed.

Switch back to your terminal window and experiment with scaling the number of instances for each of your apps.
Note how X-Ray shows the changes in real-time, by adding or removing the coloured block indicators.


## Crash Recovery Demo

Install the following Lattice demonstration application:

`ltc create lattice-app cloudfoundry/lattice-app`

Scale the app to 2 instances, and with viewing X-Ray in the background, kill the instance by appending `exit` to the URI:

`http://lattice-app.<lattice-url>/exit`

Observe how the app gets restarted.  Once you've finished experimenting, remove the app.


## Start an Instance of Redis

You can also install pre-packaged Docker images, such as MySQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.  See http://lattice.cf/docs/docker-image-examples/.
Go ahead and install an instance of Redis.

`ltc create redis redis -r`

You can see the port mapping by running the `ltc status redis` command.


## Finishing Up

  * To stop Lattice: vagrant halt

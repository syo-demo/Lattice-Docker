# Installation and Setup

The necessary steps are:

 1. Install VirtualBox
 1. Install Vagrant
 1. Setup Docker
 1. Setup Lattice


___Please note___: Lattice cannot easily be used on Windows nor _any 32-bit platform_ because the `ltc` command-line utility is missing.  In the meantime, the easiest solution is to run a Linux (eg. 64-bit Ubuntu) virtual machine on your Windows PC and follow the Linux instructions.

All the following is command-line driven. You will need to run a shell/Terminal window on Linux/MacOS.

## VirtualBox

VirtualBox allows virtual machiness to run on Linux, MacOS or Windows.  We will be running two virtual machines:

  1. Docker Server daemon
  1. Lattice itself

Go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and under "VirtualBox platform packages" find and download the installer for your platform

Run the installer.


## Install Vagrant

Go to https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html, download the installer for your platform and run it.

___Note___: On MacOS vagrant is installed in `/Applications` but is _not_ added to the execution path.,  You can add
`/Applications/Vagrant/bin/` to your execution path in your shell's configuration file (for example in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`). Or explicitly invoke `/Applications/Vagrant/bin/vagrant up` in the setup below.


## Docker Installation

Docker runs client-server:
  * Client: The `docker` command-line utility
  * Server: A Linux background daemon (invoked using `boot2docker`).  Runs in a VM on Apple MacOS or MS Windows (hence needing VirtualBox)

### Linux

The docker server runs natively on Linux. so you can install it using `apt-get` or `yum` in the usual way.

  * Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/
  * CentOS: https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/
  * Other: There are many other supported Linux platforms. Go to the Docker homepage https://docs.docker.com/ and
choose the "Installation" menu.   Select the right Linux for you and follow the instructions.

### MacOS

The easiest way to install is to use the Homebrew facility:

```
   > brew update
   > brew install docker
   > brew install boot2docker
```

Alternatively download the installer package from here: https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/latest
then refer to https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/ for installation details.

### Windows

Download the installer from https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer/releases/latest and run it.

For full details see: https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/

As per the instructions, run "Boot2Docker Start" from "Start Menu" - "Docker".

## Docker Setup

Run the following:

```
  > docker --version
  > boot2docker version
```

The `boot2docker` utility runs the Docker server. It needs initialising (you only have to do this once):

```
  > boot2docker init
```

To run the server:

```
  > boot2docker up
```

Once it's running, it should tell you to set some environment variables.  On MacOS/Linux it will be something like this:

```
  > export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.xxx.xxx:2376
  > export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/your-name/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
  > export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
```

You might like to set these permanently:

  * MacOS/Linux: Add to your shell configuration file (for example to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`)
  * Windows: Add to your system environment variables (right click `My Computer` > `Properties` > `Advanced system settings` > `Environment Variables`)

Check things are working, run:

```
  > docker info
```

We will need to know the IP address the Docker VM is running on (remember this):

```
  > boot2docker ip
  192.168.59.103
```

## Sign Up to Docker Hub

If you don't already have an account, you will need to sign up for one at `https://hub.docker.com`.


## Lattice Installation

Lattice will run as a virtual machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant (a facility for creating and configuring lightweight, protable VMs).

It also needs a command-line utility `ltc` to interact with it.

### Install Lattice VM

Lattice is at Github, so setup is easiest if you have `git` installed.  (Alternatively, instead of using `git clone`, go to https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice in your browser, click on Releases and click Latest Release. Scroll down and download the source code as a Zip, and unpack somewhere convenient.)

Run the following (the last step takes a while):

```
  > git clone git@github.com:cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice.git  # or download a Zip and unpack
  > cd lattice
  > git checkout <VERSION>                                       # see below for version
  > vagrant up --provider virtualbox                             # patience - takes several minutes to run
```

The latest version of Lattice can be found at the bottom of the Lattice home page: http://lattice.cf/.  At the time of writing it is v0.2.3 (so substitute `git checkout v0.2.3` in the command above)

In the current directory you will find a file called `Vagrantfile` which uses Vagrant to configure a VM (in this case a VM running Lattice).  The VM runs when you invoke `vagrant up`.

The last line of output from `vagrant up` above is something like this:

```
==> default: Lattice is now installed and running. You may target it with the Lattice cli via: ltc target 192.168.11.11.xip.io
```

Remember this `xip.io` URL.

## Deploy Lattice in a Cluster with Terraform

The previous section describe a local deployment of Lattice on a single VM with Vagrant. A scalable cluster deployment of Lattice can be launched with Terraform. We currently support link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/blob/master/terraform/aws/README.md[AWS] , link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/blob/master/terraform/digitalocean/README.md[DigitalOcean] , link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/blob/master/terraform/google/README.md[Google Cloud] and link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/blob/master/terraform/openstack/README.md[Openstack].

#### Troubleshooting

If you get this error, your VirtualBox installation is out of date or corrupted (try installing VirtualBox again):

```
VBoxManage: error: VBoxNetAdpCtl: Error while adding new interface: failed to open /dev/vboxnetctl: No such file or directory
```

### Install ltc Utility

Finally you need the `ltc` utility.  This allows applications to be deployed to Lattice (equivalent to `cf` for Cloud Foundry).

You will need to go to https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice/tree/master/ltc and in the Setup section find the Release for your platform and download it - a single executable.

Once it is downloaded, you then need to put it somewhere on your path, for example `/usr/local/bin`.



___Windows___

Because there is no `ltc` utility for Windows, you will require a Linux VM running in VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.


___Linux___

```
  > sudo wget https://lattice.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/linux-amd64/ltc -O /usr/local/bin/ltc
  > sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ltc
```

___MacOS___
```
  > sudo wget https://lattice.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/darwin-amd64/ltc -O /usr/local/bin/ltc
  > sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ltc
```

You should now be able to run:

```
  > ltc --version
  ltc version v0.2.3

```

To use lattice, we need to tell ltc where to find it:

```
   > ltc target <lattice-url>
```

The `lattice-url` was provided by the last line of output when Lattice booted.  In the output above it was `192.168.11.11.xip.io` so you would run `ltc target 192.168.11.11.xip.io`.

For a full list of `ltc` commands and options, see http://lattice.cf/docs/ltc.

You are now ready to use Lattice to run an application.

#### Troubleshooting

If you've switched networks from the time you installed the Lattice VM, you may see the following error when running `ltc` commands:

```
Error connecting to the receptor. Make sure your lattice target is set, and that lattice is up and running.
	Underlying error: Get http://receptor.192.168.11.11.xip.io/v1/desired_lrps: dial tcp: i/o timeout
```

If that's the case, you can avoid this in the future by installing `dnsmasq` and following the instructions at https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice#troubleshooting.
